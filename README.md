# Redux
## Core

---
#### Mission

You have to develop a Redux app with React Native binding that will work in both iOS and Android platforms. For convenience we are only going to test the app in iOS iphone simulator. We expect you to fully understand the concept of redux and implement it in the project. Wen also require you to do the project with following parameters

* Project dashboard to show how you complete project features
* Git feature branches, commit message:
* Guideline: https://medium.com/@steveamaza/how-to-write-a-proper-git-commit-message-e028865e5791
* Example: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commits/master
* A release with change note
* Installation instruction in Readme.md

#### Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. 

 Redux has no relation to React. You can write Redux apps with React, Angular, Ember, jQuery, or vanilla JavaScript

#### WayPoint 1: Convert ReactNative Basic app to Redux

You have to convert the previous ReactNative project ReactNativeBasic App which you had done before into a Redux app. You have to convert all its functions and work flow in accordance with Redux concepts.

#### WayPoint 2: Convert IntekWeather app to Redux

You have to convert the previous ReactNative project IntekWeather App project which you had done before into a Redux app. You have to convert the components into Redux only if you find them to be efficient when compared with pure ReachNative.
